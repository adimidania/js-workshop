## Terms

- JSX: A syntax extension of JavaScript, created for React JavaScript Framework.
- Vanilla JavaScript: The core language for everything (Node.js, React.js etc).
- ECMAscript: It is not the language itself, but the official description of how the language should be interpreted by browsers.
