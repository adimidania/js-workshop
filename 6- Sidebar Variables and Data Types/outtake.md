# Summary

- A variable is simply a container.
- The `var` statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value. For example `var x=1, y=2, z="blue"`.
- Since the `var` declares a globally-scoped variable, let's say `x`, this variable can be modified from a function, check `script.js` to get a better understanding.
- On the other hand, the `let` statement declares a block-scoped local variable. This will allow us to get rid of the scope issue that we had with var.
