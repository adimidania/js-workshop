# Summary

- The term function is typically used to refer to as a function that sits on itself whereas a method is a function that sits inside an object and acts on that object. They're effectively the same thing, they just appear in different contexts.
- Arrow functions are a short way of declaring functions. You can check `script.js` for a better insight.
